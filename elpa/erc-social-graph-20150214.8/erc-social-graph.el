;; Author: Vibhav Pant <vibhavp@gmail.com>
;; Version: 20150214.8
;; X-Original-Version: 1.0
;; Keywords: erc graph

;;; Commentary:
;; erc-social-graph scans user received messages, and generates a social graph
;; of the channel. These graphs can be later converted to a DOT graph, which
;; can be drawn into a graph using Graphviz.
